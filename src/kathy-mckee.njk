                Coach Kathy McKee, a name synonymous with excellence and dedication
                in the world of swimming. Throughout her illustrious career, Coach McKee has guided swimmers of all levels, from
                pre-competitive beginners to national-level athletes. Her impact on the sport is immeasurable, and her tireless efforts
                have helped shape the future of swimming.

            <p>Coach McKee's journey began in 1977 at Dynamo Swim Club, where she coached for 17 remarkable years. During her time at Dynamo,
                she played a pivotal role in developing Olympians, national champions, and even American record holders.
                Swimmers like Eric Wunderlich, Carlton Bruner, and Mary Ellen Blanchard owe much of their success to Coach McKee's
                mentorship and guidance.</p>

            <p>In 1989, Dynamo Swim Club achieved a historic milestone by winning the National Women's Championship, and every swimmer
                on that triumphant team had the privilege of being coached by Kathy McKee during their formative years. Such an achievement
                is a testament to her exceptional coaching abilities and the profound impact she had on the athletes she worked with.</p>

            <p>Coach McKee's coaching journey continued in 1994 when she joined SwimMAC in Charlotte, North Carolina. Kathy continued to
                make significant contributions to the swimming community. She nurtured and developed swimmers who went on to represent
                the USA National Junior Team, showcasing her ability to guide athletes to the highest levels of competition.
                Her dedication and expertise led to her being selected as a coach for the 2007 National Junior Team, a well-deserved
                recognition of her exceptional coaching skills.</p>

            <p>In addition to her accomplishments at Dynamo and SwimMAC, Coach McKee made an indelible mark during her tenure at the
                North Carolina Aquatic Club (NCAC) from 2012 to 2017. It was during this period that she was honored as the
                North Carolina Swimming Age Group Coach of the Year in 2014. Coach McKee played a pivotal role in helping NCAC swimmers
                achieve remarkable feats, including setting team and state records and producing a member of the National Junior Team.
                On four different occasions Kathy was named the Georgia Age Group Coach of the Year.
                In 2019 Kathy McKee was inducted into the Georgia Aquatic Hall of Fame.</p>

            <p>Coach McKee's influence extended beyond the pool deck. Kathy was a kind and compassionate friend and mentor to many.
                She served on numerous committees with USA Swimming, North Carolina Swimming, and Georgia Swimming, showcasing her dedication
                to the betterment of the sport as a whole. Her expertise and insights were highly regarded, leading to her appointment to
                the ASCA Board for six years. Coach McKee's passion for sharing knowledge also saw her speak at the World Clinic
                on multiple occasions, as well as at various clinics both in the United States and internationally.
                Her contributions as a coach and educator have made a lasting impact on the swimming community worldwide.</p>

            <p>Coach Kathy McKee stands as one of the leading age group coaches in the country. Her legacy is not just measured by the
                trophies and accolades earned by her swimmers, but also by the hundreds of athletes she has developed who went on to
                compete at the Junior and Senior national levels. Her dedication, expertise, and unwavering commitment to the sport have
                paved the way for future generations of swimmers to achieve their dreams.</p>

            <p>As we pay tribute to Coach Kathy McKee, we celebrate her remarkable career, her passion for coaching, and her unwavering
                commitment to the sport of swimming. Her influence will continue to be felt for years to come, and her legacy will forever
                inspire swimmers and coaches alike to strive for excellence in and out of the water.</p>

                    <p class="text-xl text-gray-500" x-text="item.name">Amy Cavanagh (Dynamo Swim Club, 1979-1990)</p>
                    <p x-text="item.body">I was asked the other day if I ever had a teacher that was a positive influence on my life. I immediately told him Kathy McKee. That evening, I saw a facebook post from our Dynamo coach Alex of her passing.

I was thrilled to reconnect with her a few years back. We texted and talked on the phone, holiday cards went to her, she was always so complimentary of me and my son.  And while I am the mom, she was still giving me advice in my old age. She didn’t have children of her own, but she was absolutely a mother and a teacher. I would take advice from her any day of the week about child development - no questions asked. She was just that good about development of kids and had such a great disposition. I talked to her just this past January about swimming, congratulated her on her incredibly well-deserved semi-retirement from MAC. She deserved that hall of fame award like no other. She deserved rest and travel and to live life outside those pool decks (like Alex). Like many swim coaches, she dedicated her life with hours, days, months, and years on the deck in the morning and evening. Dealing with crazy age group kids and parent neurosis. She believed in me. She developed me. She stayed on me teaching me inside the pool and out. Because that is who she was. She cared so much about each of us. They don’t make them like this always. Like many others that I was fortunate to swim beside in 1979 when I joined Dynamo, she made sure we were ready to be handed up to David and then to Alex. She wasn't my coach, but came and drove me to the ’88 Olympic Trial finals trying to talk my little 15 year old self off a ledge. She was there to talk to me when I missed the Olympic team that night. She was always there for each of us - good and hard – and she will ALWAYS be top of mind for me as the TEACHER and North Star in my life.  I’m so thankful that I got to see her in GA when she received the Hall of Fame.

I wish she could see the outpouring of THANK YOUs from around the world with the valuable mentoring and her hugely impactful handprints she left on our lives.  She was so humble, barely ever taking the credit rather putting the credit back into the kids for the work they did and providing constructive criticism on how they could and would be better. She deserved to travel the world and reconnect and have the rest and time she never got - just to simply be.

Rest easy Kathy, your legend will live on. The universe just got one hell of a teacher.

We shared a love of gardening and antiques but most of all dogs.  She loved her cocker spaniels.  There have been many wonderful, heartfelt comments about her career as a swim coach but she was an even better friend.  I will miss her dearly.  </p>

                    <p x-text="item.body">I first met Kathy the summer of 1981 on a Zone Meet trip. I was swimming for a smaller club in Atlanta at the time and she as was one of the Zone coaches. The minute I got back from the trip, I told my parents I wanted to join Dynamo and swim for Kathy. That changed everything for me. A few years after college, I found my way back into swimming and started coaching in Atlanta. This was at the same time Pat and Kathy had moved to NC and started coaching at MAC. I joined the MAC staff in the fall of 95 and had the incredible fortune of working with Kathy and the Davidson program of MAC. Loved every moment in the Lake Normal area. I have always thought that swimmers have life stories different that other athletes, and part of that is because of the impact our coaches had on us, and Kathy is a Mt Rushmore kind of coach. Thanks for life path Kathy and the memories I have had since meeting you all those years ago!</p>

                    <p x-text="item.body">Kathy taught my kids to be better swimmers.  In many small ways, she taught me to be a better parent.  She was a model of consistency--she treated the kid who was struggling in the pool the same as she treated the kid who was knocking out quad A's.  She was quick to give feedback--criticism as well as praise.  She never let a swimmer get too low, or too high.  She knew how and when to push a kid's buttons--and how hard to push.  She was a role model for the swimmers, and the same for her fellow coaches.  Kathy never had kids of her own, but in retrospect, she actually had several thousand kids as she treated each one as if they were hers.  I will miss our numerous conversations over the past 27 years about kids, swimming, MAC, crazy parents, and spaniels.  And I will always remember that booming voice and her shouting this greeting to me after a big victory----"how about those Heels!"   </p>

Watching her lead the development and growth of the northern end of the program I learned a tremendous amount from her.  She took interest in every swimmer at every level of the program to help them be the best that they could be.

I was so sad to hear this news. I will miss you Kathy </p>

When I joined her senior team, I was intimidated but also very excited to train with a phenomenal coach who was admired throughout the swimming community.  During the time I spent swimming for MAC, Coach Kathy truly got to know me both in and out of the pool.  Even though I may not have been one of her fastest and most experienced swimmers, she nurtured and encouraged my dedication and passion for the sport.  I feel incredibly blessed to have had the honor of training under one of the greatest coaches of our generation.  Kathy, you will be dearly missed, and I know in my heart you will always be with every swimmer whose life you touched.   </p>

You were my coach when I was 12 in 1984. I never amounted to any kind of swimmer but I went on to coach summer league for several years and I hope I made some of those kids love swimming like you did for thousands of kids. My own kids are now at Dynamo and are the same age I was when you coached me. They have a fantastic coach, Martha, and the circle remains unbroken. You don’t remember me but I will never forget you. Thank you. </p>

As a coaching colleague/teammate,  she was the very best at mentoring coaches and athletes, and creating blueprints for success, both in the water with athletes and on the admin side for clubs. She worked tirelessly and selflessly for others at the highest levels of our sport. She was a great friend, a cocker spaniel loving Mom, and a TarHeel through and through! Each of us will hold her memory dear. She will be missed beyond measure.</p>

                    <p>Coach McKee's journey began in 1977 at Dynamo Swim Club, where she coached for 17 remarkable years. During her time at Dynamo,
                        she played a pivotal role in developing Olympians, national champions, and even American record holders.
                        Swimmers like Eric Wunderlich, Carlton Bruner, and Mary Ellen Blanchard owe much of their success to Coach McKee's
                        mentorship and guidance.</p>

                    <p>In 1989, Dynamo Swim Club achieved a historic milestone by winning the National Women's Championship, and every swimmer
                        on that triumphant team had the privilege of being coached by Kathy McKee during their formative years. Such an achievement
                        is a testament to her exceptional coaching abilities and the profound impact she had on the athletes she worked with.</p>

                    <p>Coach McKee's coaching journey continued in 1994 when she joined SwimMAC in Charlotte, North Carolina. Kathy continued to
                        make significant contributions to the swimming community. She nurtured and developed swimmers who went on to represent
                        the USA National Junior Team, showcasing her ability to guide athletes to the highest levels of competition.
                        Her dedication and expertise led to her being selected as a coach for the 2007 National Junior Team, a well-deserved
                        recognition of her exceptional coaching skills.</p>

                    <p>In addition to her accomplishments at Dynamo and SwimMAC, Coach McKee made an indelible mark during her tenure at the
                        North Carolina Aquatic Club (NCAC) from 2012 to 2017. It was during this period that she was honored as the
                        North Carolina Swimming Age Group Coach of the Year in 2014. Coach McKee played a pivotal role in helping NCAC swimmers
                        achieve remarkable feats, including setting team and state records and producing a member of the National Junior Team.
                        On four different occasions Kathy was named the Georgia Age Group Coach of the Year.

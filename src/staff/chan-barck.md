bio: >-
  Chandra “Chan” Barck has been an integral part of SwimMAC since 2015,
  currently serving as the North Swim School Manager at the HFFA/Davidson sites.
  In her role, Chan oversees registration for swim lessons, manages staff
  scheduling, and ensures exceptional customer service for parents and future
  clients. She is also SwimMAC’s American Red Cross Lifeguard Instructor and
  brings a wealth of training, including certifications from Jackrabbit,
  SwimAmerica, USA Swimming, and ASCA Levels 1 and 2.


  Chan’s coaching and leadership experience spans a wide range too, including Marlin 2, assisting Marlin 3, JSL, Masters, and swim lessons.  She has also coached high school and middle school competitive teams, and the YMCA swim team in Belmont.  Her core values of respect, honesty, and empathy are matched by her strengths as a listener, communicator, and personable leader who fosters a supportive environment for both swimmers and staff. With a degree from Belmont Abbey College, she uses her knowledge to help find a pathway for swimmers to achieve their goals. Chan takes pride in SwimMAC’s accomplishments, such as helping with enrolling of 1,000 swimmers during the 2022–2023 School Year session.


  Her journey with SwimMAC started through a connection with a former employee, and she values the SwimMAC team as a family—a stable home base amid the frequent moves of a military upbringing. Chan’s commitment to helping individuals reach their goals stems from her love for swimming and desire to support athletes of all ages in their personal growth.


  Looking ahead, Chan’s goal is to continue developing her leadership and create more out-of-office bonding opportunities for the team. Her favorite SwimMAC memory is watching former Marlin swimmers she once coached return to teach new generations, a testament to the strong, family-like community SwimMAC fosters!


  Inspired by mentors like Coach Martha, her step-dad, and her Papa, Chan brings warmth, guidance, and dedication to her role. Her philosophy is rooted in helping individuals find their own path, knowing that while you can “Accept both compliments and criticism. It takes both sun and rain for a flower to grow.” Chan’s favorite places to travel include Croatia, Germany and Netherlands. Her best advice is to remember that you cannot enchant everyone—an insight that resonates with her empathetic approach to coaching and life.

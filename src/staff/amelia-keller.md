  Amelia Keller joined SwimMAC in August 2023 with Marlin 3 and Dolphin 3, and
  now coaches as Lead Dolphin 3, working primarily with 11-12-year-old swimmers
  at the North HFFA/Davidson site. In her role, Amelia designs and leads
  practices, creates structured season plans, and coaches meets to provide her
  swimmers with essential competitive experience. Alongside her competitive team
  role, Amelia contributes to SwimMAC’s swim school, teaching in-water swim
  lessons, and to the homeschool program, where she engages a group of
  homeschooled students in collaborative practice sessions. 


  Amelia holds a Bachelor of Science in Industrial Design from Georgia Tech and is currently pursuing a Master’s in Counseling from Wake Forest University. She brings a diverse background in coaching and teaching, having served as a summer league coach in high school and as an in-water instructor with Aqua Tots. She also has experience teaching elementary students 3D modeling, allowing her to connect with youth across various age groups and interests. Her leadership experience as a college service team lead has deepened her dedication to building supportive and motivating communities, both within and beyond the swimming pool.


  Central to Amelia’s coaching philosophy is her commitment to cultivating an atmosphere of encouragement and inclusivity. She believes that every swimmer has the capacity for growth and deserves the support to realize their potential. Grounded in her faith, she values the importance of community and connection, emphasizing that every individual is worthy of being seen and celebrated. Amelia’s resilience through personal challenges has strengthened her dedication to fostering an environment where mistakes are embraced as growth opportunities, allowing her swimmers to learn and develop confidence in both their personal and athletic journeys.


  Amelia was drawn to SwimMAC by the team’s focus on community and mutual support. Her goal is to nurture a positive team culture where success is shared and celebrated. By embodying qualities of respect, confidence, and resilience, she strives to lead by example and help her swimmers understand the “why” behind their hard work. She encourages them to not only develop their swimming skills but also build dedication to a collective purpose that reaches beyond themselves. 


  Her favorite SwimMAC memory is witnessing a swimmer put in all-out effort in their final race under her guidance, an emotional moment that reminded her of the impact of her relationships with each athlete. For Amelia, SwimMAC is a place of encouragement and connection—a true community where parents, coaches, and athletes come together to support one another’s dreams.

bio: >-
  Jen brings over 30 years of aquatics experience to SwimMAC, with a background
  that spans from competitive swimming, swim lessons, age group teams, water
  polo, and Masters programs. With a special focus on stroke development, she is
  passionate about inspiring swimmers of all ages to reach their goals and
  unlock their full potential—both in and out of the water.


  As a lifelong swimmer, her love for the sport grew into a lifelong pursuit, including competing in more than 200 U.S. Masters Swimming events across every stroke and distance. Known for her enthusiasm, Jen often rallies others to join in the fun—whether it’s encouraging teammates to compete, swimming alongside her mom in mother-daughter relays, or organizing a full family relay at USMS Nationals.


  Jen joined SwimMAC in April 2024 as an Auxiliary Coach and Swim School Instructor, quickly becoming a positive presence on deck. With experience across creative industries and management, she brings imaginative problem-solving and a fun, supportive approach to her coaching. For Jen, the best part of coaching is watching swimmers believe in themselves—and then go for it!

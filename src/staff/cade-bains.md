  Cade Bains joined SwimMAC in August 2025 as the Senior 2 Lead Coach at the
  Huntersville Family Fitness & Aquatics (HFFA) site. He leads practices that
  prepare swimmers for their competitive goals while fostering teamwork and
  personal growth. His approach combines technical instruction, strategic
  training design, and individualized coaching to help athletes succeed both in
  and out of the pool.


  Cade began his coaching career as a lifeguard and instructor before moving into leadership roles with several clubs in Colorado and Arizona. He grew a summer league program into a year-round USA Swimming team, served as Head Age Group Coach and team manager at Pikes Peak Athletics, and most recently coached in Arizona while directing a lesson program that fed into the club.


  With a background in exercise science and ongoing studies in Strategic Leadership, Cade emphasizes hard work, communication, and consistency. His philosophy centers on helping swimmers recognize their potential while building confidence, character, and a love for the sport.

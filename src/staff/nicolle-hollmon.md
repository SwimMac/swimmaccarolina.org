bio: >-
  Nicolle Hollmon joined SwimMAC in December 2018, and she now serves as the
  South Swim School Manager at the Latin site. In her role, Nicolle oversees the
  Swim School’s daily operations, manages hiring and training, and actively
  participates in teaching and managing group and private lessons. With a
  Bachelor of Arts in Communication Studies from UNC Charlotte, specializing in
  Public Relations and Journalism, Nicolle brings a strong background in
  communication and leadership to her role.


  Before SwimMAC, Nicolle coached age-group swimmers for five years and led the Caldwell Station Stingrays neighborhood swim team. Her core values of respect, honesty, trust, adaptability, and kindness are central to her approach, while her strengths in communication, creativity, and attention to detail allow her to foster a positive learning environment. Nicolle also holds an ASCA Level 2 certification, along with Lifeguard and CPR certifications, which enable her to train and support staff in various learning styles, helping them become the best instructors possible.


  After a break from swimming, Nicolle was drawn back by her love for coaching pre-team level swimmers. Her goal is to bring creativity to the program, helping staff and students alike to see that learning to swim can be fun and rewarding—a lifelong skill that everyone should have. Nicolle is dedicated to continually expanding SwimMAC’s program, growing her leadership skills, and collaborating with her new assistant to bring even more opportunities for classes and student engagement.


  One of Nicolle’s favorite memories at SwimMAC was her promotion to Swim School Manager, which gave her a deep sense of support and belief from the team. To her, SwimMAC is about building meaningful experiences that contribute to growth as both an instructor and person, creating a foundation for skills in life and in the pool.


  Inspired by her grandfather, who taught her to swim and ignited her passion for the sport, Nicolle’s philosophy is that “it’s never too late” to learn. Originally from New Jersey, she moved to Charlotte in 2009 and enjoys spending her free time reading and with her doodle, Chowder. Her favorite travel destination so far is London, where she’s inspired by the city’s rich culture and history.

  Shyann Olvera joined SwimMAC in August 2024 as the North Swim School Assistant
  Manager, based at the HFFA/Davidson location. In her role, Shyann is dedicated
  to helping families get started with swim lessons, ensuring a seamless
  registration process and providing ongoing support for both new and returning
  participants. She is passionate about making each family feel welcome,
  informed, and excited about their journey in swimming. From explaining lesson
  structures to addressing concerns, Shyann is there to answer questions and
  build confidence in SwimMAC’s programs.


  With a background in swim instruction, Shyann has coached swimmers of all skill levels, designing lesson plans and fostering a positive, safety-focused learning environment. She has also been active in various non-profit initiatives, including fundraising for homelessness programs, which has shaped her commitment to community and inclusivity. These experiences have equipped her with valuable skills in coaching, program management, and community building—skills that align perfectly with SwimMAC’s mission to promote excellence in swimming.


  Drawn to SwimMAC for its strong reputation in competitive swimming and athlete development, Shyann was inspired by the organization’s commitment to both technique and performance, as well as the supportive community and growth opportunities it offers. Her “why” for SwimMAC is rooted in her passion for nurturing talent and fostering a love for swimming, with a focus on building character, teamwork, and resilience. Shyann strives to create a positive and inclusive environment where every swimmer feels valued and motivated to reach their full potential.


  Shyann’s greatest inspiration is her great-grandfather, “Poppy,” whose resilience and optimism through challenging times taught her the importance of family, community, and staying true to one’s values. His wisdom and strong spirit continue to guide her, reminding her to embrace every opportunity with gratitude. Born and raised in sunny Riverside, CA, Shyann enjoys bringing her love for community and commitment to personal growth to SwimMAC. Her favorite piece of advice? “Embrace failure as a stepping stone to success.”

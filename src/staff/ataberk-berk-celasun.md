  Ataberk “Berk” Celasun is an assistant coach with SwimMAC Carolina, working
  primarily at the Latin (South) site. He officially joined the competitive team
  in January 2025 after starting as a Swim School instructor in March 2024.
  Today, he supports swimmers across multiple age groups, with a primary focus
  on Dolphin 3 (ages 11–12) and Shark 3 (ages 13–14)! Berk assists lead coaches
  in daily practices and meets, where he helps athletes develop strong technical
  skills, build confidence, and grow mentally and emotionally as competitors.


  Berk’s connection to SwimMAC runs deep. Originally from Turkey, he swam for SwimMAC in 2015–2016 after his family relocated to Charlotte to pursue better opportunities in education and sport. He competed internationally during his youth and brings that high-performance perspective to his coaching. In addition to his experience as a competitive athlete, Berk coached swim clinics in Istanbul and continues to stay involved in SwimMAC’s Swim School and Junior Swim League programs, helping beginners gain foundational skills and comfort in the water.


  With a strong belief in character, consistency, and resilience, Berk is committed to creating a supportive and motivating training environment. His coaching philosophy centers on developing the whole athlete—not just their strokes and speed, but their mindset, work ethic, and values. He emphasizes clear communication, positive reinforcement, and personalized feedback to help swimmers of all backgrounds feel valued and encouraged.


  Berk’s core values include integrity, passion, and commitment. He believes in meeting athletes where they are, adapting his approach to help each swimmer thrive. His goal at SwimMAC is to keep learning and growing as a coach while helping swimmers reach their fullest potential, both in the pool and in life. Long-term, he hopes to lead his own training group and contribute at the senior level.


  Berk draws inspiration from his international journey, his mentors in both Turkey and the U.S., and the athletes he works with every day. One of his favorite quotes is from Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, founder of modern Turkey: “I like athletes who are intelligent, agile, and also morally upright.”


  This mindset guides his daily work—helping young people become not only stronger swimmers but also confident, thoughtful individuals. Coaching, for Berk, is more than a job; it’s a calling, and SwimMAC is the community where he’s proud to grow, lead, and give back.

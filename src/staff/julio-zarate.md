  two decades of experience, passion, and dedication to coaching young athletes.
  Since joining SwimMAC in 2022, Julio has led the Senior I group, overseeing
  their athletic and personal growth, from technical training to character
  development. He also manages and mentors the North Site coaching staff,
  fostering a culture that aligns with SwimMAC’s mission of excellence and
  growth.


  Julio holds an ASCA Level 4 certification, is an ASCA-certified stroke technician, and was part of the ASCA Fellows class of 2008. Additionally, he is CrossFit Level 1 certified, further demonstrating his commitment to holistic athletic development. He previously led teams as Head Coach at CBAC and Swim Torrance and served as Technical Chair of the Pacific Committee for Southern California Swimming. His varied experience includes roles like Assistant Aquatic Director at St. Mary’s College of Maryland, pool manager, and assistant coach at Longhorn Swim Camp, which has enriched his multifaceted approach to coaching and team leadership.


  Guided by core values of family, perseverance, learning, and empathy, Julio is known for his commitment to continuous self-improvement and his ability to connect meaningfully with athletes. He is passionate about helping athletes develop discipline, resilience, and confidence, focusing on meeting them where they are and guiding them to the next level. His vision for SwimMAC involves a return to the foundational principles that made it one of the country’s leading programs, combined with innovations to keep SwimMAC at the forefront of competitive swimming.


  Julio’s dedication has been recognized with notable achievements, such as the National Diversity Select Camp Staff position, and awards like the Oregon LSC Senior Coach of the Year nomination. Throughout his career, his teams have broken LSC records in Maryland, Oregon, North Carolina, and Southern California, won major including LSC, Sectional, and Junior National meets, and his swimmers have attended national camps. Julio’s goal at SwimMAC is to inspire and empower young athletes, helping them look back on their SwimMAC journey with pride and appreciation.


  Beyond the pool deck, Julio’s life experience has shaped his coaching philosophy. After his parents’ divorce, swimming provided him with structure, commitment, and a path forward, thanks to his club coach’s mentorship. Today, Julio seeks to be a positive influence, providing young people with the same guidance that helped him through pivotal moments. A lifelong learner, he also enjoys painting, and he has artwork currently displayed in the Charlotte area.


  Julio finds inspiration in his family and mentors, including coaches Rachael Zarate, Kerry Elliott, Chuck Batchelor, David Marsh, and Jack Roach. He believes in living in the present and overcoming fear through focus and mindfulness, likening it to the discipline of a ninja. With gratitude and strong values, Julio Zarate continues to leave a meaningful impact on his athletes, his team, and the SwimMAC community

  Rachael Zarate is a valued member of SwimMAC, where she leads the Shark North
  Division at the HFFA and Davidson sites. A lifelong connection to SwimMAC
  began when she joined the team as a young swimmer, and her coaching career
  started here after college in what she initially thought would be a “gap
  year.” Rachael returned to SwimMAC in 2022 after coaching across the country,
  including roles as Head Age Group Coach and Dryland Coordinator at Team
  Eugene, as well as coaching at Swim Torrance, the University of Northern
  Colorado, and DePauw University. Her experience also includes mentorship roles
  and team management positions in swimming governance.


  In her role with SwimMAC, Rachael leads a group of coaches and athletes within the Shark North Division, focusing on 13-14 year-olds. She develops strategies and training plans that support athletes’ growth, encouraging them to push beyond their limits to accomplish what they once thought was impossible. With a B.A. in Psychology, a minor in Visual Arts, and an M.A. in Sport Management, along with a swim-specific dryland certification, Rachael is equipped to support her athletes’ mental and physical development. Her coaching style integrates psychological insight and dryland training expertise, offering athletes a well-rounded approach to performance.


  Rachael’s core values—hope, grit, adaptability, empathy, and purpose—are reflected in her dedication to relationship-building with athletes and her commitment to helping them find confidence in new challenges. Known for her innovative approach to guiding athletes beyond their comfort zones, she aims to foster a unified Shark division that prepares athletes for success in the senior ranks and beyond.


  Reflecting on her journey, Rachael shares some standout SwimMAC memories: from her days as a swimmer at the 2006 Long Course Senior Champs to her coaching achievements, such as growing a senior group from 20 to 70 swimmers. These moments, along with the SwimMAC family that has supported her throughout her career, hold special significance for her.


  For Rachael, SwimMAC is more than a team—it’s a way of life that embodies family, athleticism, and resilience. Influenced by mentors like Julio Zarate, Russ Kasl, and Jennifer Gibson, Rachael is passionate about instilling SwimMAC’s values in each athlete she coaches, helping them realize their potential both in and out of the pool.

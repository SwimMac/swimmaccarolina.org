  Ali Sensintaffar joined SwimMAC in January 2024, bringing a diverse background
  in coaching, education, and program development to her role. Ali leads the
  Dolphin 3 group, focusing on helping 11-12-year-old athletes refine their
  technique, build effectivepractice habits, and develop the mental and
  emotional skills that foster success both inand out of the pool.


  With a Bachelor's degree in Creative Writing and a Master’s degree in English Education, Ali has taught English at the high school level and brings her educational expertise to her coaching, blending athletic skill-building with life skills. Before moving to North Carolina, she served as Head Age Group Coach at Highlands Ranch Aquatics in Colorado and asAssistant Aquatic Program Coordinator for the Highlands Ranch Community Association.Her experience in managing swim programs and understanding child development and psychology further strengthens her role in supporting SwimMAC’s young athletes.


  Ali’s coaching values center around teamwork, accountability, and respect, with a coaching style that emphasizes adaptability and continuous learning. She has a deep commitment to mental training in sports, integrating tools like goal setting, visualization,and positive self-talk to equip her swimmers with the confidence and resilience they needto succeed. Ali sees SwimMAC as a place of hope and potential, and her passion lies ininspiring athletes to recognize their capabilities and develop into well-rounded individuals.


  Ali draws daily inspiration from her swimmers, who trust her to guide them through their athletic journeys. She is also grateful for her mentors, including her first boss, Kimsey, and her first Head Age Group Coach, Jill, who both played pivotal roles in shaping her passion for coaching. Ali’s favorite advice, “Be the person you needed when you were in that situation,” reflects her philosophy of coaching with empathy and purpose. Originally from Colorado, her favorite place to travel is Ireland, and her coaching mantra embodies resilience and self-belief: “If they don’t give you a seat at the table, bring a folding chair."

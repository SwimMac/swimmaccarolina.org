  Since joining SwimMAC in 2009, Steve Robling has served as Lead Coach for
  three distinct groups: Marlin 3, Senior 3, and Masters, all based at the South
  Latin location. With a focus on creating a welcoming and growth-oriented
  environment, Steve works with Marlin 3, the entry level for swimmers aged 10
  and under in the Marlin division, and Senior 3, which introduces
  14-18-year-olds to the senior division. Additionally, he leads SwimMAC’s
  Masters program, supporting adults aged 19 and above who are continuing their
  swimming journey.


  Steve brings a strong leadership background to SwimMAC, having served as captain of his swim team during his senior year at The Ohio State University. His coaching philosophy centers around encouragement, motivation, and positivity. Steve believes in leading by example and emphasizes the importance of discipline and effort over shortcuts in the training process. By fostering an environment where swimmers feel congratulated and motivated, he helps athletes of all ages develop confidence in their abilities.


  Outside of coaching, Steve finds great joy in swimming himself, especially alongside North Carolina's finest in the Masters program. For Steve, SwimMAC represents the opportunity to be part of a supportive community that values growth, teamwork, and excellence at all levels of competition. 


  Steve’s core values are to encourage, motivate, congratulate, stay positive, and always lead by example.

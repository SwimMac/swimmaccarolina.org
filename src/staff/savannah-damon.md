  Savannah Damon leads the Marlin 2 group at SwimMAC’s Davidson location, where
  she coaches the club's 10-and-under athletes. Since joining SwimMAC in April
  2023, Savannah has been integral in fostering an environment where young
  swimmers build confidence, discover new strengths, and learn skills that will
  serve them both in and out of the pool.

  Savannah holds a B.A. in Political Science and an MBA from Lenoir-Rhyne University. Her career includes work in the non-profit sector in Davidson, NC, and she brings extensive coaching experience from roles in Pennsylvania, including as Assistant Coach at York YMCA and Head Coach at Aquatic Club of the West Shore. Her background reflects her commitment to values like respect, integrity, and hard work, principles she carries into her coaching to inspire and shape young athletes.


  Drawn to SwimMAC’s legacy of excellence and its supportive culture, Savannah is excited to contribute to this tradition and learn alongside some of the country’s best coaches. Her philosophy is centered on creating resilient, well-rounded athletes who are excited to push their limits, find success, and enjoy the process.


  A favorite SwimMAC memory for Savannah is seeing young swimmers reach milestones, like finishing a 50-yard butterfly legally for the first time. To her, these small victories are as inspiring as watching Olympians break records. Inspired by her childhood club’s motto, arete—the Greek concept of the pursuit of excellence—Savannah is passionate about always moving forward in both technique and spirit.


  A native of York, Pennsylvania, Savannah finds joy in meeting people from different cultures and trying new foods, with Madrid, Spain as a favorite travel memory. To her, SwimMAC is a community rooted in commitment, with coaches, athletes, and parents all working to become the best versions of themselves.

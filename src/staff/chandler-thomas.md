  Chandler Thomas, SwimMAC’s Masters Program Director and South Lead Coach,
  brings decades of experience and dedication to the organization, having been
  part of SwimMAC since 1997. Starting as a Junior Swim League (JSL)
  participant, Chandler progressed to the competitive team, competing with the
  club through high school and returning each summer during college. In 2011, he
  launched his Masters swimming journey and has been deeply connected to SwimMAC
  ever since. Chandler also spent three seasons as an assistant coach for the
  Senior, Dolphin, and Marlin divisions, honing his coaching skills.


  In his current role, Chandler oversees a vibrant community of over 200 adult Masters swimmers, ages 19 to 81, who range from competitive athletes and triathletes to open water and fitness swimmers. His primary responsibilities include collaborating with the Masters staff at both the HFFA and Charlotte Latin facilities to provide structured practices and competitive opportunities for all members. Chandler writes and coaches practices specifically at the Latin location, tailoring sessions to accommodate the varied skill levels and goals of SwimMAC’s diverse adult membership.


  With a Doctor of Physical Therapy degree from the Medical University of South Carolina and a Bachelor’s in Exercise and Sport Science from UNC-Chapel Hill, Chandler brings specialized knowledge in sports performance and injury management. His expertise allows him to offer swimmers comprehensive support in achieving both fitness and technical goals. Chandler’s core values—authenticity, responsibility, passion, health, and humor—shine through in his interactions with both swimmers and staff, fostering a supportive and motivating environment.


  A lifelong swimmer and physical therapist, Chandler’s mission at SwimMAC is to show that swimming is more than a sport—it’s a lifelong journey that fosters growth, resilience, and joy. He aims to expand SwimMAC’s Masters offerings, strengthen bonds between the Masters and competitive teams, and connect alumni to build a stronger SwimMAC community. For Chandler, SwimMAC is home, a place where he’s created memories of accomplishment, challenge, and mentorship.


  A highlight of his own swimming career was qualifying for his first Junior Nationals during a 100 BR time trial at the 2006 Sectionals at UGA. He fondly recalls being part of three Junior Nationals trips, especially when SwimMAC’s boys’ team won in 2007. Chandler’s commitment to swimming is grounded in the belief that “The most powerful weapon on earth is the human soul on fire,” a quote by Ferdinand Foch that resonates with his approach to inspiring others. Born and raised in Charlotte, NC, Chandler is dedicated to giving back to the community that raised him and to helping swimmers of all ages strive toward a healthy, fulfilling life in the water.

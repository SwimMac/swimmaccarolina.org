  Since joining SwimMAC in September 2014, Martha Hocutt has dedicated herself
  to building a strong swim school presence in Charlotte. Under her leadership,
  SwimMAC’s customer base has tripled, and the two locations she oversees are
  thriving. Martha began her journey at SwimMAC as a swim instructor, later
  taking on expanded roles with programs such as Homeschool, Pre-Comp, MAC Fit,
  and as an assistant coach for Dolphin 3. Her skill in communication,
  organization, and leadership propelled her into positions as North Swim School
  Deck Manager, North Manager, Senior Swim School Director, and now, Director of
  Developmental Swimming. Today, Martha ensures that every swimmer is welcomed
  into a safe, supportive environment designed to help them master this
  essential life skill.


  Martha brings a wealth of experience in aquatics, including lifeguarding at pools, lakes, and water parks, as well as teaching both swimming and in the classroom across the country. She has also served in various volunteer leadership roles, such as Vice President of the PTO and a member of the MOPS leadership team. Martha holds multiple certifications, including as a lifeguard, Chemical Pool Operator (CPO), Level 2 ASCA-certified coach, and Program Director with SwimAmerica. She is also a USMS member and LTS Certified instructor, prioritizing the highest standards of safety across all SwimMAC facilities.


  For Martha, SwimMAC is more than a renowned center for swimming; it is a community built on shared passion and teamwork. Her goal is to nurture this spirit, foster open communication within the team, and expand access to swimming lessons for families of all financial backgrounds. Martha is especially excited about the upcoming opening of a new “skills” pool in our Charlotte location, a project designed to encourage young non-swimmers to take their first steps into the water with SwimMAC.


  To Martha, swimming is more than a sport; it’s a vital life skill that everyone should have the opportunity to learn. Her dedication to swim education is shaped by those who have overcome challenges and by mentors like Kathy McKee, who instilled in her the values of resilience and leadership. Whether you’re new to swimming or getting to know SwimMAC, Martha looks forward to supporting you at every stage of your journey.

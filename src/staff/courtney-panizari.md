  Courtney Panizari joined SwimMAC in August 2024 as the Assistant Swim School
  Manager at the South - Latin site. In this role, she supports the daily
  operations of the Swim School, assisting with class registrations, engaging
  children in lessons, and stepping in to teach when needed. Her primary goal is
  to foster a welcoming and fun environment where children can discover the joy
  of swimming.


  Courtney holds a degree in Business Marketing and initially worked in sales before finding her true passion in swim instruction. She began her teaching career at Triangle Aquatic Center in Raleigh, where her enthusiasm and commitment led to private lessons and a supervisory role. Courtney’s experience in education, particularly with K-5 students, enhances her approach to managing swim programs and teaching. She is known for her honesty, kindness, and integrity, and she works to ensure a positive experience for every family and child she serves.


  Relocating to Charlotte was a significant step toward Courtney’s dream of combining her love for swimming with her passion for education. She was inspired by SwimMAC’s welcoming culture and its supportive team, and she is excited to help grow the Swim School program to reach more families and inspire young swimmers. To Courtney, SwimMAC feels like a second family—a place where swimmers develop skills, confidence, and lifelong friendships.


  Courtney’s parents have been a strong source of inspiration throughout her life, teaching her the values of resilience and perseverance. She is also deeply influenced by her mentors, Nicolle Hollman and Martha Hocutt, whose guidance has been invaluable to her journey as a coach. One piece of advice that resonates with Courtney is, “Always lead with kindness.” She holds the Dr. Seuss quote, “Unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot, nothing is going to get better. It’s not,” close to her heart, as it reflects her dedication to making a positive impact.


  Originally from Anne Arundel County, Maryland, Courtney’s favorite travel destination is London. Driven, creative, and enthusiastic, she looks forward to continuing her work at SwimMAC and helping young swimmers build confidence and skills in the water.

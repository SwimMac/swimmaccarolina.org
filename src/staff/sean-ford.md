  Sean Ford has been a dedicated member of SwimMAC since 2019, taking over as
  Marlin North Division Lead and Lead Coach for Marlin 1 and Marlin 2 at the
  Huntersville Family Fitness & Aquatics (HFFA) in 2020, bringing his expertise
  and passion to the role. Sean's approach centers on creating a positive,
  hardworking environment where swimmers feel excited to attend practice and are
  inspired to reach their potential. His coaching philosophy is deeply rooted in
  the belief that athletes need to know their coach cares about them to fully
  commit and thrive—a principle he exemplifies every day.


  Sean earned a B.S. in Physical Education from West Virginia Wesleyan College, where he also served as a board member for the West Virginia LSC. His previous experience includes head coaching roles at PKB in West Virginia and assistant head coaching at FCA in Pennsylvania, positions that equipped him with the skills to meet athletes at their level and communicate effectively. His work has been recognized with the West Virginia Age Group Coach of the Year award, highlighting his commitment to excellence in youth swimming.


  Guided by core values like family, integrity, and enthusiasm for helping young people achieve greatness, Sean strives to provide a meaningful and supportive experience for his swimmers. For him, SwimMAC represents a community with shared ideals and an environment where athletes and coaches alike can grow. A favorite part of his SwimMAC journey has been working alongside inspiring colleagues, especially Kathy McKee, who brings both wisdom and energy to the team.


  Originally from Lewiston, Maine, Sean is inspired by his wife and the SwimMAC family. He lives by the advice, “You are going to be okay,” and the belief that “Whether you think you can or you think you can’t, you’re right.” His goal is to offer a better experience to the next generation of athletes, giving them the support, excitement, and drive that will carry them far beyond the pool.

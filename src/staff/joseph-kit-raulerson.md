  Joseph Raulerson joined SwimMAC in August 2023 as the Lead Coach for the
  Senior 2 North group, based at the HFFA/Davidson site. With a strong
  foundation in both coaching and the technical development of swimmers,
  Joseph’s role focuses on guiding high school athletes (ages 14-18) to progress
  from age-group swimming to the competitive senior level. His responsibilities
  include helping swimmers identify their strengths, address areas for
  improvement, and prepare for advancement to the Senior 1 group.


  Joseph holds a BA in Natural Sciences from Johns Hopkins University and has extensive experience in various leadership roles within the swimming community, including positions as North Carolina Swimming Senior Chair, Coach Representative, and South Texas Swimming Age-Group Chair. His professional background spans a diverse range of coaching roles, from collegiate programs at Michigan, Georgia Tech, Florida State, and Bucknell, to head coaching positions at Raleigh Swimming Association and The Woodlands Swim Team. His multifaceted experience enables him to bring a unique perspective and historical understanding of the sport to SwimMAC.


  Known for his creativity, commitment to growth, and deep connections in the swimming world, Joseph regularly engages with coaching peers across the country, ensuring his methods remain informed by the latest trends and best practices. His philosophy emphasizes meeting athletes where they are, helping them reach their goals through a focus on both short- and long-term success. His guiding values include open communication, creative problem-solving, and celebrating athletes’ accomplishments, as he believes in “catching them doing something right.”


  Joseph’s achievements include recognition as the South Texas Age-Group Coach of the Year and the North Carolina Senior Coach of the Year. Since joining SwimMAC, he has launched several initiatives, including a weekly 400 IM endurance concept with Senior 1 and 2 groups and is developing a presentation on the application of work-rest ratios in practice design. With SwimMAC’s mission at heart, Joseph aims to elevate the quality of athletes progressing to the Senior 1 group and hopes to eventually contribute as a Head Age-Group Coach for the North site.


  Inspired by individuals who overcome challenges, Joseph credits mentors like Randy Reese and Jon Urbanchek for shaping his coaching journey. He believes in the power of pride and perseverance, as encapsulated by his favorite quote, “Pride grows in the hearts of men like lard on a pig.” Originally from Sanford, NC, Joseph’s favorite travel destination is Montreal, and he brings a sense of human connection and resilience to SwimMAC’s community of swimmers and coaches.

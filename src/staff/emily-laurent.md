  Emily Laurent joined SwimMAC as the Dolphin 2 Lead and Shark 2 Assistant Coach
  in January 2024, bringing a vibrant approach to coaching rooted in knowledge,
  creativity, and a passion for community. Originally from Laplace, Louisiana,
  Emily has a strong educational background in sports and coaching, with a
  Bachelor’s degree in Kinesiology from Southeastern Louisiana University and a
  Master’s degree in Coaching and Sports Performance from the University of
  Southern Mississippi.  She began her coaching journey in 2015 with the South
  Louisiana Swim Team, where she served as the Head Age Group Coach, and
  cultivated her commitment to nurturing young athletes’ development both in and
  out of the pool.


  At SwimMAC, Emily focuses on empowering her swimmers by fostering autonomy and inspiring personal growth. In her role, she helps guide young athletes through key stages of development, preparing them for both team tryouts and lifelong success. Her coaching philosophy is aligned with SwimMAC’s mission to develop champions in and out of the pool, and she is dedicated to mentoring her swimmers in ways that will impact their lives beyond their competitive years.


  Emily is excited to learn from SwimMAC’s experienced coaching team as she works toward her goal of coaching senior-level athletes in the future. She draws inspiration from her mentors, including Dr. Emily Beasley, who encouraged her passion for athletics, and Dr. Bing Athey, who guided her in aquatic sports education. Emily’s favorite advice, “Do something today that your future self will thank you for,” reflects her commitment to continuous growth and self-improvement.


  A lifelong learner of the sport, Emily’s favorite travel destination is Memphis, Tennessee—a place she loved so much that she named her 2.5-year-old Dalmatian, Memphis, after it. For Emily, SwimMAC represents a unique opportunity to build lasting connections within a supportive community, one where she’s excited to help young swimmers reach their full potential.

  Emily Laurent joined SwimMAC in January 2024 as the Lead Coach for Dolphin 2
  and Assistant Coach for Shark 2, bringing a vibrant and thoughtful approach to
  coaching that blends technical knowledge, creativity, and a passion for
  building community. Emily holds a Bachelor’s degree in Kinesiology from
  Southeastern Louisiana University and a Master’s degree in Coaching and Sports
  Performance from the University of Southern Mississippi.


  Her coaching career began in 2015 with the South Louisiana Swim Team, where she served as Head Age Group Coach and developed a deep commitment to guiding young athletes in both their athletic performance and personal growth. Over the years, Emily has continued to expand her impact through professional development opportunities. She was selected as a 2025 Timothy Welsh ASCA Fellow, a distinction aimed at developing future coach-leaders on and off the deck. The fellowship is centered around the completion of a research project done in the year between ASCA World Clinics with this years topic "Our Greatest Asset: Holding on to Great Coaches-A Coach Sustainability Study." She also participated in USA Swimming’s 2025 Women in Governance program, which identifies, educates, supports and mentors female coaches who wish to be more involved in organizational governance. 


  At SwimMAC, Emily focuses on empowering her swimmers by fostering autonomy and inspiring personal growth. In her role, she helps guide young athletes through key stages of development, preparing them for both team tryouts and lifelong success. Her coaching philosophy is aligned with SwimMAC’s mission to develop champions in and out of the pool, and she is dedicated to mentoring her swimmers in ways that will impact their lives beyond their competitive years.


  Emily is excited to learn from SwimMAC’s experienced coaching team as she works toward her goal of coaching senior-level athletes in the future. She draws inspiration from her mentors, including Dr. Emily Beasley, who encouraged her passion for athletics, and Dr. Bing Athey, who guided her in aquatic sports education. Emily’s favorite advice, “Do something today that your future self will thank you for,” reflects her commitment to continuous growth and self-improvement.


  A lifelong learner of the sport, Emily’s favorite travel destination is Memphis, Tennessee—a place she loved so much that she named her 2.5-year-old Dalmatian, Memphis, after it. For Emily, SwimMAC represents a unique opportunity to build lasting connections within a supportive community, one where she’s excited to help young swimmers reach their full potential.

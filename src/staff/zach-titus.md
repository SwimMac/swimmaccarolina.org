  Zachary “Zach” Titus joined SwimMAC Carolina in May 2024 and serves as the
  Lead Coach for Senior 3 and Marlin 3 North at the Huntersville Family Fitness
  & Aquatics (HFFA) and Davidson sites. In his role, Zach fosters a safe,
  supportive, and energetic environment where swimmers ages 6–18 can grow both
  in and out of the pool. His coaching emphasizes mental growth alongside
  technical development, helping athletes build confidence, resilience, and
  skill.


  A native of Titusville, PA, Zach swam competitively for 12 years, including at the Division I level, and brings more than six years of professional coaching experience. He studied Sports Management, Finance, and Psychology at St. Bonaventure University, where he also captained the swim team and engaged in community service projects. His coaching background includes leading the Kahkwa Club swim team and supporting programs at local high schools, YMCA teams, and summer leagues. 


  High-energy and passionate about continuous growth, Zach’s strengths lie in communication, stroke technique analysis, and creating an environment where swimmers feel valued and motivated. For him, SwimMAC is a family away from home, and his philosophy is simple: use competitive swimming as a teacher of life skills, ensuring every athlete leaves the program stronger as both a swimmer and a person.

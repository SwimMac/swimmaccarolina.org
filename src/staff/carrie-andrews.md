bio: >-
  Carrie Andrews has been an integral part of the SwimMAC family since 2002,
  where she now serves as the South Auxiliary Program Director at the Latin
  location. With a Master’s in Exercise Science, Carrie’s extensive background
  in swimming includes coaching competitive 9–12-year-olds with SwimMAC, as well
  as previous roles as a swim coach with Team Greenville (SC) and the Athens
  Bulldogs at the University of Georgia. As the Auxiliary Program Director,
  Carrie hires and manages coaches for the HomeSchool, Pre-Comp, and
  MAC Fit programs, all of which help swimmers prepare for competitive teams,
  middle and high school swim meets, or summer league competition.


  Carrie is known for her effective time management, organization, and strong communication skills, which allow her to build and maintain positive relationships with both coaches and families. As a former All-American triathlete, Carrie brings a passion for helping young swimmers realize the potential they can achieve through dedication and hard work. She aims to expand pre-competitive programs to support SwimMAC’s competitive team, while also offering pathways for swimmers not pursuing year-round competition.


  Over her years with SwimMAC, Carrie’s favorite memories include out-of-town dinners with her coaching colleagues and watching her coaches consistently go above and beyond to support their swimmers. For Carrie, SwimMAC is more than a workplace—it's where she met her husband, and her children have grown up immersed in its supportive, inclusive environment.


  Carrie’s “why” at SwimMAC is simple: she wants to help as many young people as possible discover the pride that comes from setting and achieving goals. Inspired by her mentor, Jennifer Gibson, and carrying her favorite piece of advice, “You have to believe in yourself before others will believe in you,” Carrie looks forward to each new season with enthusiasm, eager to support swimmers at every stage of their journey. Originally from Jacksonville, FL, Carrie loves to travel, with Paris holding a special place in her heart.

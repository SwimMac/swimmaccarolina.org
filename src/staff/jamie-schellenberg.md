bio: >-
  Jamie Schellenberg joined SwimMAC in June 2024 and is the Lead Coach for the
  Shark 3 group, based at the North HFFA/Davidson site. Working with swimmers
  aged 13-14, Jamie focuses on building essential skills that prepare athletes
  for both immediate success and progression to senior-level swimming. Her
  approach encompasses race strategies, practice habits, and skill development,
  all aimed at creating a strong foundation for young swimmers.


  A lifelong athlete, Jamie has been immersed in competitive swimming and triathlons, including representing Team USA at the World Triathlon Championships in New Zealand. She holds a Bachelor's degree in Criminal Justice and a Master’s in Counseling and is a Certified Level 3 Coach through the American Swimming Coaches Association, a Certified Dryland Coach, and a licensed psychotherapist specializing in youth. These combined skills provide her with a unique approach to coaching, as she brings mental strength training and life skills into her swim practices. Before SwimMAC, Jamie coached triathlon teams in the Bay Area, served as a mental strength coach for teen groups, and volunteered with Girls on the Run, fostering confidence and resilience in young athletes.


  Jamie values respect, kindness, personal growth, and community, creating a supportive and positive atmosphere on the pool deck. Her experience as a mother of three, two of whom swim for SwimMAC, gives her a parent’s perspective on coaching, allowing her to communicate effectively with swimmers of all ages. Patience, empathy, and her background in mental health make her an impactful and motivational leader.


  In her coaching, Jamie prioritizes discipline, ownership, and the fun that comes with hard work, guiding her athletes to support each other as they develop their skills. Currently, she is expanding SwimMAC’s dryland program and incorporating mental strength training for swimmers of all ages. Looking ahead, she hopes to contribute to an open water racing program, combining her passion for open water with her expertise.


  For Jamie, SwimMAC represents the lifelong benefits of sports and the character-building aspects of swimming. Her goal is to prepare swimmers who feel confident in their abilities, supportive of one another, and open to continuous growth. Her coaching philosophy centers on the idea that swimming is as much about building character as it is about technique and competition. Her children serve as her daily inspiration, and her favorite quote, “To succeed in life, you need three things: a wishbone, a backbone, and a funny bone,” reflects her belief in resilience, ambition, and joy in all pursuits. 


  Jamie grew up in Northern California and Hawaii, and her favorite place traveled is Iceland. Passionate about creating a strong team culture, Jamie is excited to continue building a positive environment that nurtures lifelong swimmers and well-rounded individuals.

  Ariel Hopper has been part of the SwimMAC family since 2009, first as a
  swimmer and now as the North Shark 2 and Dolphin 2 Lead Coach at the HFFA and
  Davidson sites. She joined SwimMAC’s coaching team full-time in 2020 after
  beginning her journey as a swim instructor in 2016. Ariel’s experience in
  multiple SwimMAC programs—ranging from Swim School and JSL to Teen Fit and
  Marlin 3—along with her decade as a SwimMAC athlete, has given her deep
  insight into SwimMAC’s values and approach.


  In her role, Ariel coaches middle-level swimmers aged 11-14, where she focuses on developing their technical skills and helping them master racing strategies to build a foundation for long-term success. She writes training plans and structures practices tailored to the unique needs of each swimmer, fostering an environment where athletes can grow and thrive.


  Ariel graduated from UNC Charlotte with a B.S. in Biology, specializing in human anatomy, and her science background is evident in her coaching. She combines a technical approach with a compassionate and adaptable coaching style, tailoring her support to meet each swimmer where they are. Ariel’s background as a chemistry teaching assistant and personal tutor further aids her ability to teach and connect with young athletes. Her coaching philosophy centers on building resilience and adaptability, guiding swimmers through both successes and challenges. Ariel draws inspiration from her own experience as an athlete, having overcome multiple knee surgeries, which taught her the value of patience, adaptability, and trusting the process.


  Ariel is passionate about the scientific aspects of swimming, especially in underwater techniques and breath control, and is currently working on innovative methods to improve swimmers’ underwater abilities. Her ultimate goal is to foster a love for the sport that extends beyond competition, helping swimmers stay engaged and avoid burnout.


  For Ariel, SwimMAC is more than a program—it’s a community where hard work and growth are celebrated. She volunteers with Beds for Kids, bringing the same spirit of support and empathy to her work outside the pool. Ariel is inspired daily by her swimmers and mentors, including Roy-Allan Burch and Kathy McKee, who remind her to make time for loved ones and live with purpose.

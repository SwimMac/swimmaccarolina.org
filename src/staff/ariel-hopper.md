  Ariel Hopper serves as the North Dolphin 2 Lead Coach at SwimMAC Carolina,
  working with competitive swimmers ages 11–12 at the HFFA and Davidson sites. A
  lifelong member of the SwimMAC family, Ariel swam for the club from 2009–2019
  before transitioning into coaching. She began part-time in 2015 and joined
  full-time in 2020, gaining experience across Swim School, JSL, Homeschool,
  Marlin, Dolphin, and Shark programs.


  In her role, Ariel designs and leads year-round practices that focus on stroke development, training skills, and long-term athlete growth. With a B.S. in Biology and concentration in human anatomy, she applies a scientific lens to training, emphasizing both safety and efficiency.


  Ariel’s coaching philosophy is rooted in empathy, patience, and connection. She strives to meet swimmers where they are, fostering resilience, adaptability, and a love for the sport. For Ariel, SwimMAC is not just where she grew up, but a community that shaped her values of hard work, resilience, and fun—values she now passes on to the next generation.

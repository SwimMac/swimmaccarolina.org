  Swimming is more than a sport for Chuck Batchelor—it’s a pathway to lifelong
  growth and achievement.  Named Director of Competitive Swimming and Head Coach
  in July 2021, Chuck has been with SwimMAC Carolina ever since, continually
  striving to elevate its standards of excellence, adding new chapters to the
  team’s storied legacy by inspiring future generations to pursue their
  greatness.  


  Chuck’s vision for SwimMAC has been self-evident in the team’s results since his arrival, with SwimMAC finishing 1st overall in the nation every year (2021-22, 2022-23, and 2023-24) according to all three major metrics: Long Course and Short Course Virtual Club Rankings; Scholastic All-American; USA Swimming Gold Medal Club of Excellence.  To bring the best competitive opportunities to North Carolina, Chuck has revitalized SwimMAC’s meet offerings with the return of the Martha McKee Charlotte Open and by creating new marquee events like the Long Course Short Course Invitational.  


  A former NCAA swimmer for the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chuck competed as a scholarship athlete, contributing to two ACC Championship teams. His coaching journey began at The Peddie School and included numerous prestigious roles, such as Head Women’s Coach for the Pan-American Games and Head Coach for the World Junior Championships.


  Prior to SwimMAC, Chuck was an established trailblazer in competitive swimming, with decades of experience cultivating excellence at every level of the sport.  He served as President, Owner, and Head Coach of Bluefish Swim Club from 2005-2021, transforming it into a nationally and internationally recognized powerhouse in the swimming world.  Under his guidance, the club produced 22 Olympic Trial qualifiers, National Champions, and world-class athletes like Olympian Elizabeth Beisel. Bluefish achieved multiple Gold Medal statuses under USA Swimming's Club Excellence program, a testament to its consistent performance and athlete development.


  Beyond the pool deck, Chuck has played a pivotal role in shaping the swimming community, serving as a Speedo Advisory Coach and as Vice-Chair on the New England Swimming Board of Directors.  His innovative presentations, including keynotes at international swim clinics, reflect his commitment to advancing the sport. 


  Chuck’s coaching philosophy centers on fostering integrity, perseverance, and excellence, inspiring athletes to surpass their potential both in and out of the water.

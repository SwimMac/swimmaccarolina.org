  Tom Avishious joined SwimMAC in August 2022, bringing nearly 25 years of
  expertise in business operations and club development with USA Swimming. Based
  at the South - Latin site, Tom manages SwimMAC’s business operations, ensuring
  the organization runs smoothly and sustainably. His focus is on creating a
  strong financial base for the club, implementing financial controls, and
  advancing the Board of Directors' goal of financial transparency.


  With a degree in Interpersonal & Public Communication and a minor in Business, Tom began his career by helping swim clubs around the country through his role in USA Swimming’s Club Development/Team Services. Tom’s work included developing and teaching USA Swimming's Club Leadership & Business Management Course and helping establish valuable programs that SwimMAC continues to use today, such as the Club Excellence Program, the Virtual Club Championship, and IMX. Known for his integrity, transparency, and servant leadership, Tom’s unique combination of business acumen and knowledge of competitive swim teams has made him a valuable asset to SwimMAC’s leadership team.


  Tom was drawn to SwimMAC by the opportunity to work with Chuck and Kathy McKee and other respected colleagues in the swimming community. SwimMAC’s strong reputation as one of the best-run clubs in the country made it the perfect fit. His current projects focus on long-term goals, including the expansion of SwimMAC’s facilities and lesson programs, making swim training accessible to more individuals.


  To Tom, SwimMAC is a welcoming community for swimmers of all ages and skill levels. He sees it as a place where individuals can pursue swimming from “cradle to grave.” Motivated by a promise to Kathy McKee to elevate SwimMAC’s business operations, he is committed to running the club professionally while fostering an inclusive and supportive environment.


  Tom’s former boss and mentor, Pat Hogan, has greatly influenced his career. Known for his commitment to lifelong learning and his dedication to getting the job done, Tom’s approach to leadership is to listen and value diverse perspectives. Originally from the northwest suburbs of Chicago, his favorite travel destinations include Sydney, Australia, and Rome, Italy.

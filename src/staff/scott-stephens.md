  Scott Stephens has been a dedicated member of the SwimMAC team since 2017,
  where he started as the North Dolphin Division Lead before transitioning to
  his current role as Event Coordinator in 2022. As SwimMAC's Event Coordinator,
  Scott oversees a wide range of exciting responsibilities, including planning
  and managing club-wide events, securing program sponsorships, directing swim
  meets, coordinating team travel, handling social media, and supporting various
  SwimMAC programs. With a keen eye for detail, Scott plays a vital role in
  bringing SwimMAC’s Swim School, Auxiliary, Competitive Team, and Masters
  programs together through well-organized, impactful events.


  Scott brings a wealth of experience to SwimMAC from his earlier roles in South Carolina, including his position as Head Age Group Coach for Y-Spartaquatics (YSSC) from 2013 to 2017, where his team achieved Gold Medal Status and multiple Y-National Championships. In addition to his coaching achievements, Scott served as the Age Group Chair on the Board of Directors for South Carolina Swimming, where he managed major events like the Age Group Championships, Select Camps, and Zones. His contributions to the sport were recognized in 2017, when he was named South Carolina Age Group Coach of the Year. Scott also earned leadership roles as Head Zone Coach for both North Carolina (2018) and South Carolina (2015 and 2016).


  Scott’s background in Sport Management from Wingate University fuels his strengths in organization, dependability, and creative problem-solving. Known for his loyalty, integrity, and honest approach, Scott is a “straight shooter” who brings energy and innovation to SwimMAC’s events each year, setting new benchmarks for fundraising and community engagement. His favorite part of his role is elevating the culture of fundraising within SwimMAC, which he sees as essential for building the program’s future.


  A die-hard South Carolina Gamecocks fan, Scott embraces SwimMAC’s culture of excellence and is deeply inspired by his wife and son to bring his best to the team each day. With a love for his work and a commitment to SwimMAC’s mission, Scott lives by the mantra, "Roll with the punches & figure it out,” making him a steady force and positive influence within the SwimMAC family.

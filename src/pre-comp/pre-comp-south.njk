        <h2>SwimMAC's Pre-Competitive Program (Pre-Comp 1 & 2)<br>
        (formerly Junior Swim League)</h2>

        <p class="lead">
            Take the next big step in your swimmer's journey!
            SwimMAC's Pre-Comp program bridges the gap between swim lessons and year-round competitive swimming.
            Our expert coaches focus on building strong technique, boosting endurance, and growing confidence in all four strokesâ€”all in a fun, team-like environment.
            With practices designed to mirror the structure of a competitive team, Pre-Comp 1 & 2 prepare swimmers to successfully transition onto a competitive swim team.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
            Swimmers who have completed level G7 of the SwimMAC swim school may register without a tryout.
            All other swimmers must complete a tryout prior to registration.
            Contact Carrie Andrews <a href="mailto:candrews@swimmaccarolina.org">candrews@swimmaccarolina.org</a> for a tryout.

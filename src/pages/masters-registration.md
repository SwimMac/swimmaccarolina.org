<h2 class="separator-center">Equipment</h2>

<p>Besides a swim suit, goggles, and a swim cap, there are several pieces of training equipment that we may use during practices. You won't need all of this equipment at every workout, but it is a good idea to have on hand a kickboard, pull buoy, paddles, fins, and a snorkel. We do have some gear available in the lost and found bins for you to use during your first visits.</p>

<p>If you need to purchase any equipment, check out the Kiefer Aquatics Store at either of our two locations or <a href="https://www.usms.org/admin/lmschb/gto_reg_30daytryout_regform.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><a href="https://www.kiefer.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">online</a>.</p>

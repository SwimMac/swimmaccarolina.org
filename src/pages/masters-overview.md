<h2 class="separator-center">What is Masters swimming?</h2>

<p>The word "Masters" swimmer has nothing to do with your skill level or competency, just your age. Unfortunately, the name can be intimidating to some. The only requirements to be a Masters swimmer are that you must be <b>18-years-old</b> and registered with <a href="http://www.usms.org/reg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">US Masters Swimming</a>. Nationally, there are over 65,000 registered US Masters swimmers!</p>

No matter what your skill level, there is a place for you in the SwimMAC program.

<h3>Competition</h3>
<p>
We encourage competition (both in a pool and/or open water) but it is not mandatory. We find that once an athlete gets to a comfortable competency, they enjoy the motivational and social aspects of swimming that go along with competition and practice. Masters are split into age groups of five-year blocks beginning with 18-24, 25-29, 30-35, all the way up to 100+. We attend short course yards, short course meters, and long course meters meets throughout the year as a team. We also compete in various open water swims.

<h3>Triathlon</h3>
<p>
    Many of our SwimMAC Masters compete at the national and world levels in sprint and distance triathlons.
    We have several IRONMAN competitors on our team and find that their dedication and effort brings great value to the entire Masters team.
    Our triathletes also train with triathlon groups and find that the practices and coaching received at SwimMAC Masters greatly benefit their overall results.

<h3>Fitness</h3>
<p>Breathing is normally the biggest obstacle for adults who want to learn and enjoy swimming as a form of fitness. Learning to breathe while swimming is about patience and the ability to do many repetitions. Most adults underestimate themselves and their ability. In our program, swimmers will get direction and encouragement from both the coaches and their pool pals. Every SwimMAC Masters practice offers different rest interval options for each set in the workout. Practices can be modified to fit each swimmer regardless of speed and fitness level.</p>

<h3>Beginners</h3>
<p>In order to participate in our Masters program we recommend that swimmers are able to swim at least 2 lengths (50 yards) of freestyle without stopping and preferably 1 length (25 yards) of another stroke (backstroke, breaststroke, or butterfly). For those who need to improve their basic skills as a swimmer or become more comfortable in the water, the SwimMAC Swim School offers an Adult-Learn-to-Swim (ALTS) program.</p>

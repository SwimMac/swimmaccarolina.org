                    <h2>Competitive Swimming</h2>
                    <p>
                        The word “Masters” swimmer has nothing to do with your skill level or competency, just your age. Unfortunately,
                        the name can be intimidating to some. Masters swimming is truly for everyone!
                        <strong>You must be 18-years-old </strong> to be a Masters swimmer and register with US Masters Swimming
                        <a href="http://www.usms.org/reg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">USMS</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Nationally, there are over 65,000 registered US Masters swimmers! We encourage competition
                        (both in a pool and/or open water) but it is not mandatory. We find that once an athlete gets to a
                        comfortable competency, they enjoy the competitive and social aspects of swimming that go along with
                        competition and practice. Masters are split into age groups of five-year blocks beginning with
                        18-24, 25-29, 30-35, all the way up to 100+. We attend short course yards, short course meters, and
                        long course meters meets throughout the year as a team. We also compete in various open water swims.

                    <h2>Triathlon Swimming</h2>
                    <p>
                        Many of our SwimMAC Masters compete at the national and world levels in sprint and distance triathlons.
                        We have several IRONMAN competitors on our team and find that their dedication and effort brings great value to the entire Masters team.
                        Our triathletes also train with triathlon groups and find that the practices and coaching received at SwimMAC Masters greatly benefit their overall results.

                    <h2>Fitness Swimming</h2>
                    <p>Breathing is normally the biggest obstacle for adults who want to learn and enjoy swimming as a form of fitness. Learning to breathe while swimming is about patience and the ability to do many repetitions. Most adults underestimate themselves and their ability. In our program, swimmers will get direction and encouragement from both the coaches and their pool pals. Every SwimMAC Masters practice has 4 ability levels offering different intervals (i.e., rest or distance times) for each set in the workout. We have a place for every swimmer!</p>

                    <h2>What do I need when I show up on the pool deck?</h2>
                    <p>Swim suit, goggles, cap, fins, paddles, pull buoy, snorkel and kick board. You won't need all of these aids at every practice. We do have some gear in the lost and found bins for you to try on your first visits. Not sure where to buy swim gear? Head over to the Carolina Swim Shop either online or at one of our two locations.</p>

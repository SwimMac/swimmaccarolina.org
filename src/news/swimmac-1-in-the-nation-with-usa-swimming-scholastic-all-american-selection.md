SwimMAC has a history of producing both high performing swimmers and high performing students. The combination of performing as an athlete and as a student is a daily practice of self-discipline and goal-oriented thinking. Each year our coaching staff looks forward to reviewing the list of athletes, published by USA Swimming, named to the Scholastic All-American Team. This year, <!--EndFragment--> SwimMAC accumulated the highest number in the country, having 29 swimmers recognized for their accomplishments in the classroom and the pool. These numbers contributed significantly to the North Carolina LSC’s success, topping the charts as the #1 LSC in the country. SwimMAC is very proud of these individuals as they exemplify what it means to be a student-athletes.

Eligibility for the Scholastic All-America Team requires high schoolers to maintain a 3.5 GPA and swim a time equal to the 2019 Winter Junior National time standard in an individual event during the qualification period.

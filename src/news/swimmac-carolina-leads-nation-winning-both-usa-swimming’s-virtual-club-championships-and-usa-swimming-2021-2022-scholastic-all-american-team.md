Last week SwimMAC was announced as the # 1 team in the country placing the most swimmers on the USA Swimming Scholastic All American Team.

Congratulations to the 28 SwimMAC Swimmers that were named to USA Swimming’s Scholastic All-American team. Once again SwimMAC lead the nation and helped North Carolina Swimming become the top LSC in the Country.

SwimMAC prides itself on being great examples both in the pool and the classroom. This is a great honor for these swimmers and is the result of a lot of hard work in both arenas. Each year our coaching staff looks forward to reviewing this list and we are very proud of the swimmers named to the Scholastic All-American Team! These young people exemplify what it means to be a successful student-athlete and are preparing themselves to be successful not only in college but beyond.

To be considered for the Scholastic All-America Team, swimmers must maintain a 3.5 GPA for the current academic year and swim a time equal to the 2022 Winter Junior National time standard in an individual event during the qualification period. High school students must have completed the 9th, 10th, 11th or 12th grade in order to be eligible for inclusion.

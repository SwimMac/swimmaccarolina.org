Effective January 4, 2021, Brandi Jones will join SwimMAC Carolina as their new Executive Director leading overall program operations, facilities management, and driving proactive community engagement. A 15-year veteran of the nonprofit sector, with an MBA from Pfeiffer University, Brandi was the clear choice for this new role with SwimMAC. “Brandi has a track record of excellence throughout <!--EndFragment--> her career. She sets high standards and has demonstrated her ability to unite and lead an organization to ensure it is operationally and financially sound,” stated SwimMAC Executive Director Search Committee Chairman and Board Member Matt McFee. McFee led SwimMAC’s Search Committee through a six-month nationwide search.

Her past experiences, including nine years in leadership roles with the Greater Charlotte YMCA, have honed her skills in developing high quality programs with successful partnership relations, and clear, effective financial and operational skills. In addition, Brandi has extensive experience applying outcome driven performance metrics, expanding funding streams through grants and donor relations, and working across diverse communities.

Supplementing her professional expertise, Brandi obtained a Business Process Improvement and Management Certificate from UNCC, participated in Center for Creative Leadership’s, Leadership Essentials Training Program, and engaged in an Executive Coaching and Mentoring Training Program. Brandi has also participated on several Boards and Committees within the Charlotte community focused on underserved populations, social capital, and equity. In 2015 she was awarded the Harry Brace Servant Leadership award and in 2012 received recognition for her service excellence.

We are excited to have Brandi join our SwimMAC family to help us raise the effectiveness of our team, our national brand, and our local community outreach efforts. We welcome any questions you have regarding these changes.

“We are thrilled for the opportunity to bring Brandi’s deep experience to bear for SwimMAC,” said SwimMAC Carolina Board President James Meacham. “Through her passion for the regional Charlotte non-profit community, and her past successes in building and leading successful organizations, we are confident that Brandi will take us to the next level and we are honored she will call MAC home.”

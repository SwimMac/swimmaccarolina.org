<!--StartFragment-->

Director of Competitive Swimming Curriculum and Coaching Development, Eric Lane to succeed Terry Fritch as acting Head Coach of SwimMAC Carolina.

Head coach, Terry Fritch has made the decision to resign his role with the club. His last day will be August 18, 2020. We appreciate his 17 years of dedication to SwimMAC Carolina, including his last four years serving as Head Coach, and the improvements he made in both our competitive and learn-to-swim programs. During this period, <!--EndFragment--> SwimMAC athletes regularly achieved top finishes across all levels of the Club, and our swim school and development programs taught thousands of children to learn to swim.

As we begin to work through a thoughtful transition, effective immediately, Eric Lane has been named as acting Head Coach for SwimMAC Carolina. Eric is well-prepared for this new assignment. He currently serves as our Director of Competitive Swimming Curriculum and Coaching Development, and he brings valuable perspectives to further development and mentoring of coaches as we seek to advance a culture and a program that is centered on excellence in instruction. Eric is an active member of the American Swimming Coaches Association (ASCA), and during his tenure he has designed training protocols and plans for members of the US, Israeli, and Brazilian National\
Teams.

This transition represents the execution of a planned and thoughtful succession strategy. We look forward to expanding Eric’s leadership role and wish Terry Fritch all the best in his next endeavors.

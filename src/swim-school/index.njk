            proper technique. Our skill progression structure sets students up for success, and establishes a strong foundation while
            instilling a love of swimming in a positive and supportive environment.

                    <h3>Additional Benefits</h3>

                    <p>
                        Swimmers will have access to the Endless Pool (SwimMAC Training Center in South Charlotte).
                        The smaller pool is heated to warm temps for younger swimmers while providing a quiet setting in a private room.
                        It features adjustable current with mirrors on the pool floor/ceiling to provide excellent visible feedback
                        to improve technique and make adjustments. It’s a great learning environment for both new students and experienced
                        swimmers. (Class sizes are limited to three swimmers.)

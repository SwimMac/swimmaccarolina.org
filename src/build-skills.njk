                        <p>
                            SwimMAC’s Teen Fit is for kids age 11 to 18 who are looking for a program that will prepare them for middle school,
                            high school, summer league swimming, or a fun way to stay fit or cross-train for other sports.
                            Each class will have elements of aerobic development, stroke technique for all strokes, turn work,
                            and some fun and exciting aquatic games.

                            SwimMAC’s Junior Swim League offers a chance for your child to improve technique in all 4 strokes with
                            individual attention from highly qualified coaches, gain endurance & strength, and have fun with swimming!
                            JSL has been a stepping stone from lessons or summer league to competitive swimming for many of our
                            current SwimMAC athletes.

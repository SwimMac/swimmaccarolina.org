                            SwimMAC's Mac Fit is for kids age 11 to 18 who are looking for a program that will prepare them for middle school, high school,
                            summer league swimming, or a fun way to stay fit or cross-train for other sports. Each class will have elements of aerobic
                            development, stroke technique for all strokes, turn work, and some fun and exciting aquatic games.

                            SwimMAC's Pre-Comp allows swimmers the opportunity to continue the fun of summer league throughout the year.
                            Pre-Comp offers a chance for your child to improve in all 4 strokes with individual attention from highly qualified coaches.
                            Swimmers gain endurance, strength and confidence while having fun with swimming. Pre-Comp can be a stepping stone from lessons or
                            summer league to year round competitive swimming.

            <h3>Important Information</h3>
            <p>No pets allowed in the facility unless service animals.</p>
            <p>When entering the facility, stop by the lifeguard in the pool area to pay for your pass, <span style="font-size: inherit;">show your pass, or to have your pass initialed. We accept CASH or CHECKS only.</span></p>
            <p>You must sign in with the lifeguard and shower prior to entering the water. There are <span style="font-size: inherit;">heated showers available on deck and in the locker rooms.</span></p>
            <p>No one older than 5 years of age is allowed in the opposite gender’s bathrooms.</p>
            <p>Please ask the lifeguard for the other locations of bathrooms / changing rooms you may <span style="font-size: inherit;">use.</span></p>
            <p>No children under 13 years of age may be left unsupervised anywhere in the facility</p>
            <p>unless participating in an organized SwimMAC program. Please read posted pool rules on site for your safety and the safety of others.</p>
            <p>Only approved SwimMAC coaches and Swim School instructors are permitted to give lessons during lap swimming hours. Private instruction or group lessons by those not employed by SwimMAC is prohibited.</p>
            <p>Swimmers may ONLY use the designated lanes due to safety and other programs.</p>
            <p>Come to the pool expecting to circle swim. Circle Swimming means staying to the right of the black line and switching sides when you make your turn to keep the lane line on your right side. If there are fewer&nbsp;than three people in your lane, you may split a lane and take either the left or right side, while your lane-mate takes the other.</p>
            <p>Remember the pool is not a treadmill, we can accommodate A LOT of swimmers!</p>
            <p>Enjoy!</p>
